## 🔥 Who am I?

I’m Matrix—your guide through the digital underground. A coder, hacker, and all-around troublemaker who thrives in the shadows of the internet. Don’t expect easy answers, because I only leave breadcrumbs for the brave.

I spend my time building, breaking, and evolving systems at the speed of thought. Whether it’s code, security, or just a few lines to push boundaries, I’m all in. Expect the unexpected, and prepare for complexity.

## 🚀 Technologies I Live By

- **Languages**: Python, C, JavaScript, Bash
- **Tools**: Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, Git, Docker, 
- **Frameworks**: Django, Flask, Node.js, and whatever else gets the job done.

## 💥 My Digital Manifesto

I believe in pushing limits, questioning authority, and **defying the status quo**. The internet is a battlefield, and only those with a sharp mind and steady hand make it out the other side.

## 🛠️ Here’s What You Can Expect From My Repos:

1. **Clean, Efficient Code** – Because sloppy code is for amateurs.
2. **Mind-Bending Challenges** – Prepare for puzzles that will twist your brain and leave you asking, "How did I not see that coming?"
3. **No BS Documentation** – I won’t bore you with fluff. Straight to the point.
